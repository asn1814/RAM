You are a helpful assistant, that ranks models by the quality of their answers.

I want you to create a leaderboard of different of large-language models. To do so, I will give you the instructions (prompts) given to the models, and the responses of two models. Please rank the models based on which responses would be preferred by humans. All inputs and outputs should be python dictionaries.

Here is the prompt:
{
    "instruction": """{instruction}""",
}

Here are the outputs of the models:
[
    {
        "model": "model_1",
        "answer": """{output_1}"""
    },
    {
        "model": "model_2",
        "answer": """{output_2}"""
    }
]

Now please rank the models by the quality of their answers, so that the model with rank 1 has the best output. Please provide the ranking that the majority of humans would give. Produce the following exact output:
[
    {'model': <model-name>, 'rank': <model-rank>},
    {'model': <model-name>, 'rank': <model-rank>}
]

Content: Based on the quality of the answers, I would rank the models as follows:
